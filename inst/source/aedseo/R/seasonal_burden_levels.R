#' Compute burden levels from seasonal time series observations of current season.
#'
#' @description
#'
#' This function estimates the burden levels of time series observations that are stratified by season.
#' It uses the previous seasons to estimate the levels of the current season.
#' The output is results regarding the current season in the time series observations.
#' NOTE: The data must include data for a complete previous season to make predictions for the current season.
#'
#' @param tsd `r rd_tsd`
#' @param family `r rd_family()`
#' @param season_start,season_end `r rd_season_start_end()`
#' @param method A character string specifying the model to be used in the level calculations.
#' Both model predict the levels of the current series of
#' observations.
#'  - `intensity_levels`: models the risk compared to what has been observed in previous seasons.
#'  - `peak_levels`: models the risk compared to what has been observed in the `n_peak` observations each season.
#' @param conf_levels A numeric vector specifying the confidence levels for parameter estimates. The values have
#' to be unique and in ascending order, (i.e. the lowest level is first and highest level is last).
#' The `conf_levels` are specific for each method:
#'   - for `intensity_levels` only specify the highest confidence level e.g.: `0.95`, which is the highest intensity
#'     that has been observed in previous seasons.
#'   - for `peak_levels` specify three confidence levels e.g.: `c(0.4, 0.9, 0.975)`, which are the three confidence
#'     levels low, medium and high that reflect the peak severity relative to those observed in previous seasons.
#' @param decay_factor A numeric value between 0 and 1, that specifies the weight applied to previous seasons in level
#' calculations. It is used as `decay_factor`^(number of seasons back), whereby the weight for the most recent season
#' will be `decay_factor`^0 = 1. This parameter allows for a decreasing weight assigned to prior seasons, such that
#' the influence of older seasons diminishes exponentially.
#' @param disease_threshold `r rd_disease_threshold(usage = "levels")`
#' @param n_peak A numeric value specifying the number of peak observations to be selected from each season in the
#' level calculations. The `n_peak` observations have to surpass the `disease_threshold` to be included.
#' @param only_current_season `r rd_only_current_season`
#' @param ... Arguments passed to the `fit_percentiles()` function.
#'
#' @return `r rd_seasonal_burden_levels_return`
